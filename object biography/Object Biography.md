In order to create my visual novel I used [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/).
I used a couple websites to gather my historical information:
- https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-churchill-led-britain-to-victory-in-the-second-world-war
- http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/churchill_becomes_prime_minister
- http://www.antiquesfromtheretreat.com/ceramics-and-china/winston-churchill-toby-mug-royal-doulton-1st-year-of-production-1940

I used my own [sonification](https://soundcloud.com/user-994863578/sonified-churchill) of data from my 3d model, which was the result of my Module 2 work.

I also used historical photographs from Google in the visual novel.
