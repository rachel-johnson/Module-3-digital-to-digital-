# Figuring out the Images
---
March 18, 2018

I wasn't able to insert images into my visual novel the first time I tried, but I decided to return to figure it out after finishing the text.
- I returned to the [Quickstart](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html#images) to try and see what mistake I made the first attempt
- I realized that I had inputted each image in the editor with 'bg' in front of it, like in the example, but that it was supposed to be just the name of the image
- I removed the 'bg' from the images I had inputted, saved it, and tried starting the game 
- The images now appeared in the visual novel, but they were spaced weirdly
- I inputted all the images
