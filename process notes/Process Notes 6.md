# Continuing to Build - Adding Sonification
---
March 16, 2018

I finished writing all my text in the visual novel.

I then tried to figure out how to insert sound/music into my visual novel:
- I followed the directions in the Quickstart
- I used the 'play music' statement in the editor and added the sound file for my sonification to the game directory
- I then started the novel to see if the music was working
- It wasn't playing so I went back to the editor again
- I realized I had placed the 'play music' statement before the 'label start', meaning that it wasn't included as happening during the game
- I moved the statement to right after 'label start' and started the novel again
- This time the sonification did play during the novel, it plays on a loop
- I noticed that the sonification works really well with the text:
    - It is fairly fast paced which relates to the stress and sense of urgency experienced in Britain during war
    - When the song finishes playing one time there is a pause before it repeats which helps to provide a break for the player and further emphasises the eraticness of the sonification
- The sonified data from the 1940's Winston Churchill Toby Jug works to augment the text of the visual novel
- It adds an additional element in which the player can interact with historical information regarding Churchill in 1940's England through the digital world
