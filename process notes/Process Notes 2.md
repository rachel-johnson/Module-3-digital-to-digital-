# Visual Novel

After deciding to built a visual novel, I needed to figure out how to acutally built one.
- I looked at the example Professor Graham made called [Nile Diary](https://github.com/shawngraham/renpy-projects/tree/master/Nile_Diary-1.0-dists) 
- It gave me a good idea on how the end result could function and appear
- I then looked at the [Renpy Visual Novel Engine](https://www.renpy.org/)
- I downloaded the program/tool
- I did the [Quickstart](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html) in order to better understand how to use the tool

I need to figure out which Module creation to combine with my visual novel.
