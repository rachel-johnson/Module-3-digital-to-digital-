# Starting to Build
---
March 14, 2018

I followed the [Quickstart](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/quickstart.html) for Ren'Py:
- I downloaded the program/tool
- I then extracted and ran the program
- I created a new project, selected the resolution and the colour scheme
- I saw that you can incorporate music/sound in the visual novel, so I decided to combine my Module 3 with [my sonification](https://soundcloud.com/user-994863578/sonified-churchill) from Module 2. 
- I needed to figure out how to incorporate my Churchill sonification/toby jug into a narrative
- I decided to use the creation of the jug in 1940 as a starting point - focusing on Britain in World War 2 and specifically Churchill's role in the war
