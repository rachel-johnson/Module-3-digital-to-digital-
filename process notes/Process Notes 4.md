- While starting to build my visual novel I was easily able to follow how to create characters, different scenes, and write the text in the text editor.
- I ran into problems when trying to input background images into my novel. 
- I followed the directions on the quickstart, but the images were not appearing in the novel.
- For some reason they weren't appearing, even when I tried copying the way the examples showed the images inputted. 
- This was very worrisome to me, as the images are an integral aspect of a visual novel. They are the 'visual' part of a visual novel. 
- I decided to focus on the text, and come back to figuring out the images afterwards.
