# Figuring Out the Type of Game
---
March 1, 2018

I started my work in regards to Module 3 by looking through the different things posted on the FAQ for Module 3.

- I was most intrigued by the options of building an [interactive fiction](https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3812w18/wiki/How-can-I-build-an-interactive-fiction%3F) and creating a [visual novel](https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3812w18/wiki/How-do-I-build-a-visual-novel%3F).
- I looked through both and decided to built a visual novel.
- I now needed to figure out how to incorporate either my Module 1 or Module 2 creation into the visual novel.
