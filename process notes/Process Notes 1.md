# Figuring Out the Type of Game
---
March 1, 2018

I started my work in regards to Module 3 by looking through the different things posted on the [FAQ](https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3812w18/wiki/FAQ) for Module 3.

- I was most intrigued by the options of building an interactive fiction and creating a visual novel. 
- I looked through both and decided to built a visual novel.
- I now needed to figure out how to incorporate either my Module 1 or Module 2 creation into the visual novel.
