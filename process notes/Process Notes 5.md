I decided to focus on Churchill coming into office in England 1940 in order to incorporate my previous Modules.

- I found several websites with information on Churchill and World War 2 to draw on for my visual novel:
    - [How Churchill Led Britain To Victory in the Second World War](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-churchill-led-britain-to-victory-in-the-second-world-war)
    - [Churchill Becomes Prime Minister](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/churchill_becomes_prime_minister)
- I also used the website I sited in Module 1 about the Toby Jug:
    - [Winston Churchill Toby Mug](http://www.antiquesfromtheretreat.com/ceramics-and-china/winston-churchill-toby-mug-royal-doulton-1st-year-of-production-1940)
